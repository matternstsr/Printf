_printf
_printf() is a simple printf function that can be used to print formatted output to stdout. The format string is a string that contains special formatting codes that tell _printf() how to interpret the arguments that are passed to it.

The following are the conversion specifiers that _printf() handles:

Conversion specifier	Description
%c	Print a character
%s	Print a string
%%	Print a literal '%' character
%d	Print an integer in decimal notation
%i	Print an integer in decimal notation (the same as %d)
The following conversion specifiers are not handled by _printf():

Conversion specifier	Description
%b	Print a binary number
%u	Print an unsigned integer
%o	Print an octal number
%x	Print a hexadecimal number in lowercase letters
%X	Print a hexadecimal number in uppercase letters
%p	Print a pointer address
%+	Print a signed integer with a leading plus sign if the value is positive
%#	Print a number in a format that is specific to the type of number being printed
%l	Print a long integer
%h	Print a short integer
%-	Left-justify the output
%r	Print the reverse of the input string
%R	Print the rot13 encoding of the input string
